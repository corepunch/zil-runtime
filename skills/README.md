# Adventure Skills Reference

This folder contains reference source materials for the stage-specific skills located under `.opencode/skills/`.

## Source Mirrors

These preserve the full canonical source material used by the individual skills:

- `source_zil_text_adventure_agents.md` — Full design & implementation reference (830 lines)
- `source_writing_adventures.md` — Full craft + technical manual (1911 lines)
- `source_design_lessons.md` — Design lessons and principles

## Skill Pipeline

The staged adventure-building guidance lives in `.opencode/skills/`. Each skill folder contains a `SKILL.md` with detailed instructions for that stage. Load a skill with:

```

## Non-Negotiable: Play As You Build

Do not write the whole adventure and wait for Stage 6 to play it. Build vertical slices:

1. Write the exact player commands for one room or puzzle in `TRANSCRIPT_TESTS.md`.
2. Implement only that slice.
3. Start a fresh game and execute those commands through `llm.lua`, one saved invocation per command.
4. Test the obvious noun variants, wrong order, repeated action, inventory, and save/reload boundary.
5. Add the successful commands to the automated parser-driven walkthrough.
6. Continue only when the slice passes.

The walkthrough grows with the game. At every commit-sized milestone, all implemented slices must still be playable from a fresh game.

## Critical Rules (from Real Bugs)

**These caused broken games. Read before implementing.**

1. **No `<SYNTAX ...>` in dungeon.zil and no redefinition of standard syntax** — standard SYNTAX comes from substrate (`infocom/zork1/syntax.zil`). A genuinely new verb may add one narrow declaration in `actions.zil`.
2. **No `<ROUTINE V-LOOK ...>` in actions.zil** — V-LOOK comes from substrate. Redefining it breaks room descriptions.
3. **Room descriptions use `P?LDESC` not `P?DESC`** — `P?DESC` is the room name, `P?LDESC` is the full description.
4. **Every `<TELL>` must close with `>`** — unclosed TELL swallows subsequent code.
5. **GO must exist in actions.zil** — entry point for the game.
6. **Assign one visible description owner** — focal/portable objects usually own `FDESC`/`LDESC`/`DESCFCN`; permanent or stateful scenery may be room-owned and backed by `NDESCBIT` objects or pseudos. Test rendered `LOOK` output for duplication, dead `FDESC`, and stale state.
7. **Never freeze mutable state into `LDESC`** — follow Zork I's `EAST-HOUSE` pattern.
8. **Object IDs and DESC text are not parser vocabulary** — every reachable object needs explicit `SYNONYM` nouns and `ADJECTIVE` modifiers.
9. **Opening a container must make contents reachable** — use container/search flags, set `OPENBIT`.
10. **Evidence and milestone counters must be idempotent** — guard one-time increments with per-clue flags.
11. **Default verb routines never redispatch themselves** — `PERFORM` already visits object actions before the default.
12. **Parser syntax and action routines are separate deliverables** — a `V-*` routine does not register a typed verb.
13. **ASK uses the TELL action and `PRSI` topic** — NPC routines test `<VERB? TELL>` and compare the topic in `PRSI`.
14. **Puzzle clues and executable sequences must agree** — reconcile prose, hints, object availability, implementation order, and the parser-driven walkthrough before shipping.
15. **FDESC/LDESC text is the parser vocabulary contract** — every concrete noun in description text that a player might reasonably type must resolve to that object or another object in scope.
16. **ACTION routine text must match game objects** — when a TELL inside an ACTION routine mentions an object by name, that object must exist in the game world.
17. **Don't override EXAMINE on containers** — the Zork engine automatically lists contents via `V-LOOK-INSIDE` → `PRINT-CONT`.
18. **Physical nouns are objects, not Boolean shortcuts** — if prose says there is a door, window, switch, drawer, rope, vehicle, or other thing, create an `OBJECT` for it.
19. **Custom V-GO routines must mirror every conditional exit** — every conditional exit declared on rooms must be replicated inside the matching V-GO routine.
20. **NPCs and key objects need generous, overlap-tested vocabulary** — give every NPC role-based synonyms, title adjectives, and `ARTICLEBIT`.
21. **No two objects in overlapping scope may share DESC or SYNONYM sets** — identical `DESC` strings on objects that can be in scope together cause disambiguation loops.
22. **Dynamic room text must faithfully reflect object state** — every state-dependent phrase must be paired with the exact flag check that produces it.
23. **NPC-given items must guard against early TAKE** — if an NPC carries an item meant to be given during conversation, the item's TAKE handler must check the relevant global.

See `skills/source_writing_adventures.md` and `skills/source_zil_text_adventure_agents.md` for full details, or load `skill zil-implementation` for the critical implementation rules.
