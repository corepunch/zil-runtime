# The Limehouse Killings — Companion Coverage

## Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Declared rooms | 11 |
| Reachable rooms | 11 |
| Unreachable rooms | 0 |
| State families identified | 19 |
| State families authored | 19 |
| State families validated | 0 |
| Unique choice IDs | 100 |
| Total CHOICE calls | 122 |

The companion has authored routing for every declared room. This report does
not establish complete validated coverage: the manifest records zero validated
state families, and the focused regression does not execute every emitted card
from an isolated matching state.

| Study | `SUGGEST-STUDY` | 20 | 3 | AUTHORED |
| Library | `SUGGEST-LIBRARY` | 18 | 2 | AUTHORED |
| Dining Room | `SUGGEST-DINING-ROOM` | 14 | 2 | AUTHORED |
| Kitchen | `SUGGEST-KITCHEN` | 6 | 1 | AUTHORED |
| Garden | `SUGGEST-GARDEN` | 10 | 1 | AUTHORED |
| Greenhouse | `SUGGEST-GREENHOUSE` | 5 | 1 | AUTHORED |
| Servants' Quarters | `SUGGEST-SERVANTS-QUARTERS` | 10 | 1 | AUTHORED |
| Secret Passage | `SUGGEST-SECRET-PASSAGE` | 4 | 1 | AUTHORED |
| Pantry | `SUGGEST-PANTRY` | 4 | 1 | AUTHORED |

## Choice Kinds

| Kind | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `CHOICE-PROGRESS` | 42 | Actions that advance the investigation |
| `CHOICE-INVESTIGATE` | 35 | Examination, reading, observation |
| `CHOICE-INTERACT` | 18 | NPC conversation, sensory exploration |
| `CHOICE-EXPERIMENT` | 12 | Cipher pushes, pulling wires, trying mechanisms |
| `CHOICE-RETURN` | 15 | Navigation back to previous rooms |

## State-Aware Behavior

### Entrance Hall (4 state families)
- **Act I (study locked)**: Shows study door attempt, library, dining, kitchen, magnifier
- **Act I (study open)**: Shows study entry, library, dining, kitchen, magnifier
- **Act II (cipher solved)**: Shows study, library, dining, kitchen, bell wire
- **Act III (Lestrade present)**: Shows evidence presentation, accusation, NPC interaction

### Study (3 state families)
- **Exploration**: Take letter, poison, examine box/chalk/desk/window
- **Box puzzle**: Guide toward prerequisites (letter, poison ID, ledger)
- **Complete**: Focus on returning to hall with evidence

### Library (2 state families)
- **Act I (cipher unsolved)**: Take items, read page, ask Moriarty, push books
- **Act II (cipher solved)**: Enter secret passage, take ledger, return to hall

### Dining Room (2 state families)
- **Acts I-II**: Take seal, interview Lady Ashworth, examine cabinet
- **Act III**: Show evidence to Lady Ashworth, navigate to pantry/hall

## Known Limitations

1. **Child mode choice limit**: Default `--child` shows 3 choices. `main.lua`
   allows an override only from 1 through 5; the previously documented
   `--choices 6` setting is invalid.
2. **Hub navigation**: Entrance hall has 5 possible moves (study, library, dining, kitchen, gate) but only 3 can display with default limit.
3. **Cipher puzzle**: Requires 4 sequential book pushes (red→yellow→green→blue) which may require multiple turns with limited display.
4. **Evidence depth**: Five of the 12 focused tests inspect source strings.
   There is no exhaustive matching-state command executor yet.

## Authoring Optimization Retrospective

This companion is a useful stress test for the authoring workflow:

- The 1,133-line source repeats common hall navigation and return cards across
  act routines. Emit invariant choices once outside state branches or use a
  small movement helper to centralize `group = move`.
- Begin each state with the three cards needed by child mode, then add only
  distinct cards that can actually surface in story mode. One hundred IDs for
  11 rooms increased validation work without proving coverage.
- Build state-family counts from the room records. The original commit summary
  said 11 while the room entries totaled 19; this audit corrected the summary
  to 19.
- Replace repeated fresh-process child runs with one in-process runner and
  named checkpoints at the gate, hall, cipher, study, evidence, and accusation
  milestones.
- Have that runner execute every visible ID from an isolated checkpoint and
  emit JSONL containing the state-family ID, mode, visible set, selected ID,
  command, output assertion, and postcondition.
- Generate this report and factual transcript excerpts from the manifest and
  JSONL. Hand-maintained counts and copied transcripts should not be release
  evidence.
- Add a preflight linter for malformed forms, duplicated adjacent calls,
  ID/command drift, missing move groups, manifest/source mismatches, and
  unsupported CLI limits before any playthrough begins.
- The current source gives that linter real cases: repeated/orphaned
  `CHOICE-DETAILS`, a duplicated `sp.examine-walls` form, and an Act III
  “Go to the study” card whose hidden `south` command conflicts with the
  entrance hall's northward study exit.

## Architecture Notes

- `SUGGEST-ACTIONS` dispatches to room-specific routines based on `HERE`
- `SUGGEST-SCENE` provides atmospheric descriptions for each room
- Helper routines (`SUGGEST-HALL-ACT1`, etc.) handle act-specific logic
- All helper routines are defined BEFORE `SUGGEST-ACTIONS`/`SUGGEST-SCENE` to avoid ZIL forward-reference issues
- `CHOICE-DETAILS` attaches metadata: `subject`, `once`, `learns`, `group`
