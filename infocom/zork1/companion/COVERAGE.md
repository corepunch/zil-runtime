## Key Design Decisions

1. **Generic maze handling**: All maze rooms (except MAZE-5 which has unique items) share
   a generic `SUGGEST-MAZE` routine with compass directions and explore.
2. **Generic dead-end handling**: All dead ends share `SUGGEST-DEAD-END` with a back command.
3. **River rooms**: All river rooms share `SUGGEST-RIVER` with downstream and land commands.
4. **Mine rooms**: All coal mine rooms share `SUGGEST-MINE` with compass directions.
5. **Forest rooms**: All forest rooms share `SUGGEST-FOREST` with explore and compass.
6. **State-aware conditions**: Key puzzles like dome rope, dam water levels, and cyclops
   have appropriate conditional cards.

## Known Gaps

- Validated command execution evidence (parser confirmation) is pending for newly added rooms.
- Child and story mode numeric-only playthroughs have not been run.
- Save/restore persistence testing for new rooms is pending.

## Exemptions

None. All 110 rooms are reachable and have authored companion support.
