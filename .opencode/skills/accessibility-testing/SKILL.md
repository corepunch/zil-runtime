description: Test target-audience approachability and accessibility through explicit player personas, fresh sessions, and evidence-based usability findings
---

Evaluate whether the intended audience can perceive, understand, operate, recover from, and complete the adventure. Accessibility is not the same as making every puzzle easy.

## Inputs

- A technically playable packaged build
- Target audience and content expectations from `DESIGN.md` and `package/METADATA.md`
- Hint, recap, objective, transcript, save/restore, and timing behavior

If the target audience is absent or vague, record that as a product-definition finding. Use a conservative provisional audience only to continue the audit, and label the assumption.

## Required Personas

Run each persona from a fresh save and keep their knowledge separate:

1. **Target novice:** Fits the declared audience but has little parser-fiction experience.
2. **Target regular:** Fits the audience and understands common text-adventure conventions.
3. **Access-needs stress persona:** Uses transcript review and keyboard-only input, benefits from plain progress communication, has limited working-memory tolerance, and cannot rely on rapid reactions or subtle formatting.

Add a child/co-play, second-language, or genre-sensitive persona when the declared audience makes it relevant. Personas are test lenses, not claims that one simulation represents every real person.

## Audit Areas

### Operability and parser approachability

- The opening teaches or demonstrates how to begin without requiring prior parser folklore.
- Likely natural commands and reasonable synonyms work or produce corrective guidance.
- Parser failures preserve the player's idea and suggest the missing form without dumping a full command menu.
- Disambiguation, pronouns, `AGAIN`, correction, save, restore, and transcript review are understandable.

### Orientation and cognitive load

- Current location, exits, immediate goal, progress, inventory, and important state changes remain recoverable after a break.
- Essential clues are repeatable or recorded; completion does not depend on remembering a one-time wording detail.
- Note-taking is supported where the design expects it.
- Text density, sentence structure, naming, and clue load fit the target audience.

### Difficulty, recovery, and hints

- Challenge comes from reasoning rather than guessing exact wording.
- Wrong-but-reasonable attempts teach something.
- Hints escalate from attention to direction to action to exact command, and are available before frustration becomes abandonment.
- Irreversible actions, death, resource loss, and timer pressure are telegraphed and recoverable as promised.
- Optional accommodations do not silently alter the default challenge unless declared.

### Perceivability and safety

- Essential information appears in text and is not conveyed only by capitalization, spacing, color, sound, animation, or timing.
- Output order is transcript- and screen-reader-friendly: location, change, and actionable consequence are understandable linearly.
- Keyboard-only play reaches every required function.
- Content warnings and intensity expectations match the intended audience where relevant.

## Evidence and Classification

For every material finding record persona, prerequisite state, exact command, output, expected support, impact, confidence, and whether the issue concerns:

- functional parser/state behavior;
- usability or onboarding;
- cognitive accessibility;
- timing or recovery;
- content suitability;
- optional preference.

Stable functional failures should be handed to `@tester-game` for independent reproduction and regression authoring. Do not encode subjective ease, prose taste, or persona preference as a regression.

## Output

Create `<game-name>-accessibility-review.md` with:

- declared audience and assumptions;
- persona session summaries and stall points;
- audit findings with evidence;
- barriers separated from optional conveniences;
- prioritized recommendations;
- an explicit `READY`, `READY WITH BARRIERS`, or `REVISE` recommendation.

## Acceptance Checks

- At least the three required personas used independent fresh saves.
- The target novice was not granted walkthrough knowledge.
- “Accessible” was not used as a synonym for trivial difficulty.
- Essential-information, timing, transcript, keyboard, memory, recovery, and hint behavior were all considered.
- Functional candidates are clearly separated from subjective findings.
